## Python bindings for Geode.

Using codegen technology to automatically generate bindings for almost all functions defined in Geode. Currently **MAC ONLY**. Windows support will be added soon!

## Important Things

1. This is WIP. Some things may not work properly, tell me if you find any big bugs.
2. Members are not implemented yet. They may come soon tho!
3. Since the cocos2d bindings do not have superclasses, you may need to cast things (use the class like a function) for proper functionality.
4. This is EXTREMELY memory unsafe. Not my fault if you crash GD. That's on you
